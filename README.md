In the brute force algorithm, the program will go through all the permutations of starting a trip from one of the cities, visiting each city once, and returning to the first cities. It shows all the possible shortest routes with the same distance out of all the permutations. The downside of this algorithm is that increasing the number of cities increases the overall time to find the best shortest route, inefficient for the TSP. The shortest distance that the authors found from this algorithm is 6047 miles, which is the same as the ACO algorithm.
