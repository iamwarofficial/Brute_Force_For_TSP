# Brute Force For TSP
 
 The developer has implemented the Brute Force algorithm into the Java Platform. To make the trials fair, the author used the same number of US-based cities. The distance between each city is identified by its latitude and longitudes coordinates. The Haversine formula is used to calculate distances between cities. The Haversine formula calculates the shortest distance between two points on a sphere using their latitudes and longitudes measured along the surface. It is essential for use in navigation.
 
 In the brute force algorithm, the program will go through all the permutations of starting a trip from one of the cities, visiting each city once and returning to the first cities. Then it shows all the possible shortest routes with the same distance out of all the permutations. The downside of this algorithm is that increasing the number of cities increases the overall time to find the best shortest route, which is inefficient for the TSP. The shortest distance that the authors found from this algorithm is 6047 miles, which is the same as the ACO algorithm. Thus, it shows it is not the most efficient algorithm for TSP
